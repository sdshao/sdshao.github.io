I am Shudi Shao, a fifth year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University. My advisor is [Dr. Guoliang Jin](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/). I am working with him on <b>performance bugs</b> and <b>concurrency bugs</b> in <b>database-backed web applications</b>. Before coming to NCSU, I obtained my bachelor degree and master degree from Department of Computer Science and Technology of East China University of Science and Technology in June 2013, and June 2016 respectively.
